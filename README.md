Running the Project
  mix run my_program.exs numNodes topology algorithm


What is working
  -- All topologies have been implemented - Line, Full, Rand2d, 3DTorus (please enter perfect cube number as number of nodes for 3D), Honeycomb, randomHoneyComb
  -- Both algorithms are working - Push Sum and Gossipsim

Largest Number of nodes
Gossip
  - line
  - full
  - rand2D
  - 3Dtorus
  - honeycomb
  - randhoneycomb

PushSum
